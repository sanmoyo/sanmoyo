- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanmoyo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sports (tennis, football, cycling, etc) and have just graduated from the University of Southampton (UK) in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for graduate opportunities in the Technology industry (UK, US (I don't require any Visa sponsorships)). An example of a specific role I would be interested in is Data Analytics. However, it is much more important for me personally to be in a firm which aligns to my underlying motivation and drive. I have completed 2 summer internships at an electricity distribution company under IET's Power Academy Scholarship scheme and I'm very keen to be involved in the transition to Net Zero as I'm passionate in the drive to a sustainable future.
