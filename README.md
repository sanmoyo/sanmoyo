- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanmoyo
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sports (tennis, football, cycling, etc) and have just graduated from the University of Southampton (UK) in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± I have completed 2 summer internships at an electricity distribution company under IET's Power Academy Scholarship scheme and I'm very keen to be involved in the transition to Net Zero as I'm passionate in the drive to a sustainable future.
